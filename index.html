I studied in <strong> Nirman High School</strong> till 8th grade and then I completed my 10th std from  <strong> Navkar Public School.</strong> Moreover, I also got some extra practical education about science from<strong> VASCSC - Vikram Sarabhai Community Science Center.</strong> I was trained from <strong> SPGT - Sandip Patel Group Tuition</strong> for my Fundamentals and for regional languages, I took tuitions of Rajdeep Brahmbhatt sir from <strong>Sarvattvam Institute</strong>!!  Consequently, I also got the opportunity to attend a visit to the <strong> ISRO - Indian Space Research Organisation - Ahmedabad</strong> to acquire great knowledge about astronomy, space science as well as about Indian rockets and satellites!!</p>
