                        <p>Well, being frank that i had been kept the sports just as a hobby or a pass-time and nothing
                              more than that but I have been active in the extra-curicular activities such as science
                              fairs, innovation fairs etc. I had been participated in the Science Fair at Navkar Public

                              life and the salt panners!! </p>
